# blockchain_implementation
A naive blockchain implementation, following lectures from Introduction to Crypto and Cryptocurrencies MOOC on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency/lecture/gFEJL/cryptographic-hash-functions)

EDIT: Name change courtesy Ashwin. 

Please note that this project is just for me (any anyone who cares) to write my own implementation of Merkel Trees and BlockChain, and does not go into the nitty-gritties of how Bitcoin is supposed to work. For that, there are lots of good resources out there, and I will be coming up with one of my own in some time.
